# Math-things
I put my math things here.
I'm a math student and I like to Latex things sometimes. It helps if you 
download the pdfs rather than try to read them on the website beacuse github's pdf reader sucks,
and ignores some of the functionality of Latex, like hyperlinking for example. 
If you want to contact me for any reason, my email is reese.lance@utexas.edu.
The dynamical systems and geometry in group theory notes were abandoned mid course because COVID is rough. The Orderability/3-Manifolds notes were also put on pause but I am planning to go back and finish those.
