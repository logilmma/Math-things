# Math-things
I put my math things here.
I'm a math student and I like to Latex things sometimes, so I'll put them here. It helps if you 
download the pdfs rather than try to read them in the github page beacuse github's pdf reader sucks,
and ignores some of the functionality of latex, like hyperlinking for example. 
If you want to contact me for any reason, my email is reese.lance@utexas.edu.
I also have a twitter @Right_Inverse if you want a more immediate way to contact me/updates about the notes.
